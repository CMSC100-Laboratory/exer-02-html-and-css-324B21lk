Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. Push the necessary files (HTML, CSS, etc.) to your remote GitHub repository
2. Go to the repository's pages section
3. Select the branch and folder that you want to publish
4. After a while, the URL for the Github page will be shown

- My key takeaway from this exercise is both HTML and CSS files are needed in order to create
a static website. File organization and commit messages are also very important for easier workflow.
